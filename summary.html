    Currently, I am a PhD student in computer science at University of North Carolina, Greensboro. My research focuses on
developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. With an academic background of signal processing, communication and
electronics engineering, and a professional experience of 4 years (July 2018 - July 2022) in AI across domains like
engineering, medical images (Ophthalmology), medical structured data, health informatics, I would like to develop
algorithms that can be used for multiple applications. Current research includes parametrization of Ophthalmic images to
develop a machine learning algorithm for automated image registration.
